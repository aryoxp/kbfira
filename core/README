FEATURES

1.  New naming conventions for easy-to-extend panada built in libraries to
    your own coded library.
2.  Interface implementation in database and session libraries. Provides
    better standardization in database and session libraries' method 
	naming.
3.  Much smaller size of it's parent framework size. Less disk space.
4.  Compatible to PHP 5.1.2 and newer.
5.  New core design in view files handling. Better handling in view, 
    now supports combination of alphanumerics and other symbol characters, 
	including but not limited to '-', '.', and supports loading other 
	view-files extensions other than .php files.
6.  Multiple applications supported for a single PanadaLite

LIMITATIONS

1.  Currently tested to be compatible only on Apache httpd webserver.
2.  MySQL is the only provided database driver.
3.  PHP native session is the only provided driver for session library.
4.  No autoloading features, except for the configuration and error 
    handling library is loaded at startup.
5.  No caching support yet.
6.  No various fancy helpers added yet as in Panada Framework other than
    configuration, session, database, URI, error, and autoloader 
	libraries.
7.  No fancy active record database functional provided built-in.
8.  No aliasing features on controllers and methods.
9.  Less documented (sorry! :P).

WORK-IN-PROGRESS

1.  Develop and test mysqli database driver
2.  Develop plug-and-play libraries to improve features as close as 
    it's successor Panada Framework.
3.  Tests on other web platform and environment.
4.  Develop in-application helpers supports.
5.  Documentations (including core blue-print design).

DEVELOPER NOTES

-   Eventhough this lite version framework file size is only 11% from 
    it's parent framework file size, don't expect to gain 89% 
	application performance increase with this framework. Performance
	increase may occur as this framework is developed to minimize the 
	framework base in developing web based applications. But the main
	core system design is basically the same with Panada Framework.
